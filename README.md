# Email Parser

## Overview
This Python script takes an email address as user input and extracts the username and domain parts. It uses string manipulation to split the email at the `@` symbol, providing a simple way to parse email addresses.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter an email address.
- Extracts the username (portion before `@`) and domain (portion after `@`).
- Displays the extracted username and domain in a formatted output.
- Strips whitespace from the input to handle accidental spaces.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: No external libraries are required as the script uses only built-in Python functionality.

## Usage
1. **Save the script**:
   Save the code in a file named `email_parser.py`.

2. **Run the script**:
   Execute the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python email_parser.py
